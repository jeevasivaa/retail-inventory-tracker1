# ðŸŽ‰ Stock Receiving System - Status Report 

## âœ… Issue Resolution Summary

### Original Problem
**User Report**: "stock receiving page not working"

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Stock receiving queries referenced non-existent columns
2. **Template Date Formatting**: Attempted to format string as date object

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Backend Fixes (app.py)
- **Stock Receiving Route**: Fixed SQL queries to use actual database schema
  - Changed `t.timestamp` â†’ `t.created_at` 
  - Removed references to non-existent columns (`reference_number`, `unit_cost`, `supplier_id`)
  - Simplified query to work with existing `transactions` table structure

#### 2. Template Fixes (stock_receiving.html)
- **Date Formatting**: Fixed template where `receipt.date` was treated as date object when it's actually a string
- **Error Handling**: Improved graceful handling of missing data fields
